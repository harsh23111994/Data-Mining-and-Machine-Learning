# Forecasting weather conditions using Support Vector Machine(SVM)

# Project Requirement
This is Academic Project demonstrates the concepts applied on Data Mining and Machine learning Project.

# Technologies Used: 
R 

# Project Brief
This included a comparison of various Data Mining methodologies using R to carry out weather forecasting like whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on factors like Humidity, Pressure, etc. The methods used were Naive Bayes, KNN, Multiple Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine(SVM). SVM gave the maximum accuracy with 98.5% rain prediction.


# Following ML Algorithms were Implimented :
- Logistic Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- KNN
- Random Forrest
- Ada Boost
- Decision Trees
- Extra Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- SVM
